This is a place to store my dwm files. Color and font scheme have been changed, and a few programs added. The MOD key has been changed to the SUPER/WINDOWS key.

Super+Enter opens an st terminal.

This config assumes that st and rofi are installed. Keybindings are commented in the config.h file to describe key behavior.

More changes to come as time goes on.
