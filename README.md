This is a place to store my dwm files. Color and font scheme have been changed, and a few programs added. The MOD key has been changed to the SUPER/WINDOWS key.

Super+Enter opens an st terminal. 

*** Keybindings currently set to use st as the standard terminal.

This config assumes that st, dmenu, and rofi are installed. Keybindings are commented in the config.h file to describe key behavior.

Have added the alpha patch for bar and border transparency, and true gaps,... 

The Fibonacci, and miniscule layouts have also been added.

More changes to come as time goes on.
